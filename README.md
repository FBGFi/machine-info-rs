## Overview

There are many crates to get information about your system. We actually are using some
of them but this crate adds a feature to constantly monitor the system without a big
overhead. 

You can probe your system for CPU or memory usage once per second and your machine performance will not be affected at all. Other crates consumed like 7-10% of CPU which
is not acceptable. But to be fair, these other crates are doing many other things apart from getting the cpu/memory usage.

This crate focus only on this, nothing else. Limited but lightweight. If you want a full featured crate better use other one.

## Example

Just a simple monitoring

```toml
[dependencies]
machine-info = "1.0.4"
```
Put this in your main.rs:

```rust
use machine_info::Machine;
use std::{thread, time};


fn main() {
    let mut m = Machine::new();
    // Please use a real PIDs!
    m.track_process(132801).unwrap();
    m.track_process(32930).unwrap();
    
    for _ in 1..100 {
        let processes = m.processes_status();
        let system = m.system_status();
        let graphics = m.graphics_status();
        println!("{:?} {:?} {:?}", processes, system, graphics);
        
        thread::sleep(time::Duration::from_millis(1000));
    }
}
```
You probably need to install libclang-dev package
```
sudo apt-get install libclang-dev
```
